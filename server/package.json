The information below captures a description of each project, and their reason for being and a description of why the attempt at that stage was abandoned. Eventually, there will be a final seed project that can be used for starting node based server projects in typescript using Mocha as the test frawework and Gulp for development workflow. Actually,there may be multiple final seed projects for different purposes; currently I envisage different seed projects for a cli app, a web server app and there may be others.",
