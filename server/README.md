# Seed project versions

This repo consists of multiple projects. Each of these projects represents subsequent attempts at creating a seed project (please see the ALPHA-README.md for more information). The information below captures a description of each project, and their reason for being and a description of why the attempt at that stage was abandoned. Eventually, there will be a final seed project that can be used for starting node based server projects in typescript using Mocha as the test frawework and Gulp for development workflow. Actually,there may be multiple final seed projects for different purposes; currently I envisage different seed projects for a cli app, a web server app and there may be others.

It was decided that this was not the best starting point for creating a gulp task for
compiling typescript. There are more basic ways for composing a default gulp task for
compiling source, which should be explored first. The way used in this example is
applicable to defining an incremental build, but at this early stage, this is not required
and more fundamental concepts needs to be explored first.
