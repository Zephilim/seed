Project Name (Greek) | Description
---------------------|------------
Alpha | First attempt using tutorial at https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/gulp.html
      | It was decided that this was not the best starting point for creating a gulp task for
      | compiling typescript. There are more basic ways for composing a default gulp task for
      | compiling source, which should be explored first. The way used in this example is
      | applicable to defining an incremental build, but at this early stage, this is not required
      | and more fundamental concepts needs to be explored first.
Beta  | Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-typescript as a starting point.
