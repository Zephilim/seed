It was decided that this was not the best starting point for creating a gulp task for
compiling typescript. There are more basic ways for composing a default gulp task for
compiling source, which should be explored first. The way used in this example is
applicable to defining an incremental build, but at this early stage, this is not required
and more fundamental concepts needs to be explored first.
