# Seed project versions

This repo consists of multiple projects. Each of these projects represents subsequent attempts at creating a seed project (please see the ALPHA-README.md for more information). The information below captures a description of each project, and their reason for being and a description of why the attempt at that stage was abandoned. Eventually, there will be a final seed project that can be used for starting node based server projects in typescript using Mocha as the test frawework and Gulp for development workflow. Actually,there may be multiple final seed projects for different purposes; currently I envisage different seed projects for a cli app, a web server app and there may be others.

## Alpha :lock:

Project Name (Greek) | Description
---------------------|------------
Alpha | First attempt using tutorial at :link: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/gulp.html

It was decided that this was not the best starting point for creating a gulp task for
compiling typescript. There are more basic ways for composing a default gulp task for
compiling source, which should be explored first. The way used in this example is
applicable to defining an incremental build, but at this early stage, this is not required
and more fundamental concepts needs to be explored first.

## Beta :lock:

Project Name (Greek) | Description
---------------------|------------
Beta  | Use :link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-typescript as a starting point.

Some progress has been made on the beta project, but during my on going investigations whilst developing this seed and in particular when I started adding tslint to the project I discovered a blog which documented a workflow using Typescript and Gulp (*"Creating a TypeScript Workflow with Gulp"* :link: https://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/creating-a-typescript-workflow-with-gulp). Naturally, my interest was piqued and so I investigated further. I will not discuss much further here, please see the next seed (Delta) for more details.
